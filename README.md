MoodMate – Sentiment-Aware Motivation &amp; Music Recommender
MoodMate is a lightweight, emotionally intelligent web application designed to respond to how you feel. Whether you're vibing high or feeling a little low-key off, MoodMate gets it — and it’s built to help.

Using natural language processing and sentiment analysis, it picks up the tone of your text and responds with either a motivational quote, an uplifting message, or a song recommendation that fits your mood. Think of it as a personal emotional support assistant — built with Python, Flask, and a sprinkle of data science.

The goal? To make technology feel more human, and make those quiet "meh" moments a little better through AI-driven companionship.

This project demonstrates skills in text preprocessing, basic ML/NLP, API integration, Flask routing, and frontend logic. MoodMate isn’t just a mood booster; it's a full-stack showcase wrapped in empathy.
